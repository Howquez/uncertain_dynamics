    There is a fixed chance of {{ risk }}% that an event occurs. Such an event reduces your
    endowment to up to {{ damage }}%. While you do not have any influence on the
    occurence of an event, you can affect the damage it evokes:
</p>

<p>
    The more you and the rest of your group contribute to the group account, the smaller the
    damage if an event occurs. Conversely, the lower the contributions, the higher the damage if
    an event occurs.
</p>

<p>
    More precisely, there won't be any damage if everybody in the group contributes his or her
    whole endowment to the group account &#8211 even if there was an event. If none of you
    contributes anything to the group account, an event will cause a damage of {{ damage }}% of
    the endowments of each and every one of you.
</p>

    The following figure visualizes this relationship.

    Note that we provide a calculator behind the <i class="bi bi-calculator"></i>-symbol. It
    takes the abovementioned formula, as well as the quota and helps you to consider different cases.
    As such, it is most important that you understand that higher contributions lead to lower damage in case of an event.

    This can also be explained by a formula.
