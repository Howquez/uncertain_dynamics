    There is a fixed probability that an <i>"event"</i> occurs during the study.
    Such an event reduces your endowment by up to {{ damage }}%.
    You will see the exact probability on your decision screen.
    <u>This probability is the same for all members of your group throughout all {{ session.config.num_rounds }} periods.</u>
</p>
<p>
    While you cannot influence whether an event occurs, you can reduce the damage it causes:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The more you and your group allocate to the group account, the smaller the damage if an event occurs.</li>
    <li>Conversely, the less you contribute to the group account, the greater the damage if an event occurs.</li>
</ul>

    How Damage Works
</h4>

<p>
    If everyone in your group allocates their entire endowment to the group account, there will be no damage even if an event occurs.
    If no one allocates anything to the group account, an event will cause a 50% reduction in everyone's endowments.
    The following graph shows this relationship: as group contributions increase (moving left to right), potential damage decreases.
</p>

<p>Example: If your group allocates 60% to the group account, an event would cause a loss of only 20% of your endowment (if it occurs).</p>

    Note that we provide a calculator behind the <i class="bi bi-calculator"></i>-symbol. It
    takes the above-mentioned formula, as well as the return rate and helps you to consider different cases.
