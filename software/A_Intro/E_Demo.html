<p>
    Here's what your decision screen will look like during the study:
</p>

<b>
    Top Section
</b>
<ul>
    <li>A banner showing the event probability (20% in this example).
    This probability is the same for all members of your group throughout all periods</li>
    <li>The left panel shows your current endowment (20 tokens in this example)</li>
    <li>The right panel shows your return rate (46% in this example).
        This is the percentage of the group account you'll receive, regardless of how many tokens you personally contributed.</li>
</ul>

<b>
    Middle Section
</b>
<p>
    A red notification panel appears only if an event occurred at the end of the previous period (after you made your decision).
</p>

<b>
    Bottom Section: Your Decision
</b>
<p>This is where you'll make your allocation decision.
    The panel explains that from your current tokens (20 in this example), you can allocate any amount to the group account.
    The tokens you do not transfer to the group account, will be allocated to your private account.
    Any tokens in your private account will remain unchanged until the next period.
    You'll enter the amount you intend to allocate to the group account in the input field on the left, then click the blue "To Group Account" button to confirm your decision.</p>
