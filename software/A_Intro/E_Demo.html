<p>
    Your decision screen will look as follows: You will see your endwoment in the top left panel;
    your quota is displayed in the top right panel; your actual decision is made in the central panel, where you have an
    input field on the left as well as a button (that submits your decision) on the right.
</p>

<p>
    In addition, there may be a red panel that shows up if an event occured. Finally, you will also see a panel informing you
    about the other group members' decision (from round 2 on).
