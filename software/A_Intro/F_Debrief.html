                            In each period, you can allocate tokens to a private account and a group account.
                            The private account yields a fixed return of 1.
                            The group account's return varies, however.
                            More precisely, the group account's return depends not only on your endowment but also on
                            how your endowment compares to the other group members' endowments:
                            The higher your endowment (compared to others), the lower your return from the group account.

                            You cannot alter the chances that such an event occurs.
                            But if an event occurs, however, the damage it causes depends on your previous decisions.
                            More precisely, the damage can reduce up to 50% of your endowments if none of the group
                            members contributed anything to the group account. If, in contrast, all group members contribute
                            all of their endowments, the damage of a potential event would be zero (and thus, not affect

                    This calculator is designed to guide your decision. Given a quota of {{ min_mpcr }}% as well as
                    your intended contribution, you can make an assumption about the other players' average contribution and
                    whether a shock will occur to calculate your return.
