<p>
    At the beginning of each period you will be asked to allocate your endowment between a
    private account and a group account.
</p>

<h4 class=" mt-4">
    Accounts & Returns
</h4>

<p>
    The tokens that you place in the <b>private account</b> have a return of 1.
    This means that, at the end of a given period, your private account will
    contain exactly the amount of tokens you put into the private account at the beginning of
    the period. Nobody except yourself benefits from your private account.
</p>
<p>
    The tokens that you place in the <b>group account</b> are summed together with the tokens
    that the other three members of your group place in the group account. Regardless of how
    many tokens you contributed to the group account, you as well as the other members of your
    group will get a share of that sum of tokens.
</p>
<p>
    The exact <b>quota</b> determining your individual share of the group account may vary from period to period,
    which is why we will display it on your decision screen in each period.

    More precisely, the return you receive from the
    group account depends on how your endowment compares to the whole group's endowments.
    In case you have an endowment while the other group members have nothing, the
    quota will be smaller. If, in contrast, you have no endowment but some other
    group member has an endowment, the quota will be higher.
    Hence, the lower your endowment in a given period (compared to others) the higher your individual share of the group
    account  in that period.
    This relationship is visualized in the following figure.

<p>
    Your endowment at the beginning of the second period will be equal to the amount of tokens you accumulated in the first period.
    Hence, you'll start the second period with all the tokens from your private account plus your individual share of the
    group account at the end of the first period.
</p>
<p>
    In the second period, you will be again asked to allocate the endowment you accumulated between a private account
    and a group account. Both the private and the group account work in exactly the same manner as in the first
    period.
</p>
<p>
    The structure of the experiment at all subsequent periods is identical: your endowment at
    the beginning of each period is equal to the amount of tokens in your private account
    plus your share of the group account at the end of the previous period.
</p>
<p>
    Your <b> total income </b>in the end of the experiment is equal to the amount of tokens in your
    private account and your share of the group account at the end of period {{session.config.num_rounds}}.

    Information
</h4>

<p>
    In each period you will be informed about
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The endowment all four group members had at the beginning of the period.</li>
    <li>How much each group member allocated to the group account and to their respective private accounts.</li>
    <li>Your share of the group account (remember it is the same for all group members).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All other participants will receive exactly the same information.
