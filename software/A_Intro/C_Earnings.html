    Your total bonus payment at the end of the study will be equal to the number of tokens you have accumulated by the end
    of period {{session.config.num_rounds}}.

    How the Study Works
</h4>
<p>
    This study runs for multiple periods. What makes each period important is that:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Your earnings from each period become your starting amount (<i>"endowment"</i>) for the next period.</li>
    <li>In each period, you will decide how to allocate your current tokens between two accounts.</li>
    <li>Your endowment for the next period will equal the tokens you earned from both accounts in the current period.</li>
    <li>The process repeats until the 10th period, when your total accumulated tokens determine your earnings.</li>
</ol>

<h4 class=" mt-4">
    Accounts & Returns
</h4>

<p>
    At the beginning of each period, you will allocate your endowment between a private account and a group account.
</p>
<p>
    The tokens that you place in the <u>private account</u> have a return of 1.
    This means that, at the end of a given period, your private account will
    contain exactly the amount of tokens you put into the private account at the beginning of
    the period. Nobody except yourself benefits from your private account.
</p>
<p>
    The tokens you place in the <u>group account</u> are combined with tokens from the other three group members.
    Each member receives a share of this combined pool.
    You will always receive a <u>return rate of at least 27.5%</u> of the total tokens in the group account,
    regardless of how many tokens you personally contributed.
</p>
<p>
    Your exact <u>return rate</u> is individual and can vary from period to period (which is why we will provide that information on your screen).
    It depends on how your endowment compares to others in your group:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        If you have a smaller portion of the total endowments in your group, you'll receive a higher return rate from the group account.
    </li>
    <li>
        If you have a larger portion of the total endowments, you'll receive a lower return rate from the group account.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    As shown in the graph below, your return rate decreases as your portion of the group's total endowments increases.
</p>

<p>
    This means everyone benefits from the group account at the same time, but your return rate changes based on your endowment compared to others.

    Information
</h4>

<p>
    In each period you will be informed about
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The endowment all four group members had at the beginning of the period.</li>
    <li>How much each group member allocated to the group account and to their respective private accounts.</li>
    <li>Your share of the group account (remember it is the same for all group members).</li>
</ul>
<p>
    All other participants will receive exactly the same information.
